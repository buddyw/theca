I have updated the version to `1.0.0`, and published it to `crates.io` to allow for installation via `cargo install`. \r\n\r\nI am welcoming bugs/features/whatever, so please `cargo install theca`, start using it, and file bugs at [https://github.com/pwoolcoc/theca](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/theca)!",
